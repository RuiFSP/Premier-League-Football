# Midterm project: Premier League Football Prediction

## Problem Description

I've always been a big fan of sports analytics and the mathematics of gambling. One of my favorite hobbies in the past was building Excel models to predict outcomes in football matches and seeing if I could beat the market. Of course, it was impossible in the long run because markets are dynamic and adjust quickly to current news, like player injuries, coaching changes, etc. Still, it’s a fun experiment, and books like Moneyball, Soccermatics, and The Numbers Game have always sparked my curiosity in model-building. 

The goal of this project is to understand which features might be most important in building a model that can predict football match outcomes—whether it’s a home win, draw, or away win
